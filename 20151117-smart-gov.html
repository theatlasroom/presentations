						<h2>Why work with government?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Every year there is some truly amazing progress being made in digital technology, but typically government agencies tend to be slow moving, slightly backwards organisations that try to tackle all the big problems at once.</li>
								<li>This can leave government out of touch with the real needs of the public and the communities they work with</li>
								<li>A quick google search for government IT fails and you can come across some major examples</li>

						<h2>CourtBot</h2>
						<img src="./images/atl-court.png" alt="Atlanta Municipal Court Queue" height="500px" />
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Developed by the Atlanta CfA fellows</li>
								<li>In Atlanta, when you receive a traffic infringement, no matter how minor, the simplest way to resolve it is to go to court and settle the matter. This results in people taking the day off work, only to stand in line waiting to get in.</li>
								<li>So what courtbot offers, is on the spot information about traffic citations</li>
								<li>Text your citation number, receive information on how to resolve your infringment</li>
								<p>CourtBot can provide information on:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>If a case can be paid immediately, the app offers a phone number and link to begin payment.</li>
									<li>If a case requires a court appearance, the app allows users to sign up for reminders, served 24 hours in advance of the case.</li>
									<li>If a case isn't in the system (usually because it takes two weeks for paper citations to be put into the computer), the app allows users to get information when it becomes available. The app continues checking each day for up to 16 days and sends the case information when found (or an apology if not).</li>
									<li>Steps to take to challenge the citation</li>

							<p>Many food stamp recipients in San Francisco discover theyve been disenrolled from the program when it is too late, and they are actually at the grocery store</p>
							<p>Recipients are then required to re-apply to be put back on the benefits program</p>
							<p>Promptly was designed to identify recipients that were about to be disenrolled and send them a text message notification before its too late</p>
							<p>While not strictly for food stamps, promptly provides features for scheduling, monitoring and sending text message notifications for any reason</p>

							<li>Research</li>
							<li>Prototype</li>
							<li>Refine</li>
							<li>Connecting</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>I am engaging with the NJC in a process of research driven prototyping</li>
								<li>I have been based there for ~3months so far focusing on research, this has involved extensive shadowing of staff, sitting in on interactions with clients and other providers and mapping processes</li>
								<li>Some of the common themes that have come from my research are issues around interactions with clients of the centre, communicating and sharing knowledge, ideas and new findings, </li>
								<li>The next steps have involved engaging staff to drive some possible prototypes we can attack based on my research findings as well as mixing in some of my ideas</li>
								<li>We will spend a couple of months trialing, testing and reviewing the prototypes to see which have worked, what hasnt worked and what could be improved</li>
								<li>Following that, we will focus on the prototypes that show the most promise for the NJC and spend a few more months refining them</li>
								<li>As well as the above, we are also helping to connect the NJC with relevant skilled businesses and individuals in their locality, with the skills and passion to help the NJC continue its work</li>
