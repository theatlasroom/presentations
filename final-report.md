# Code for Australia - NJC Fellowship
## Summary

// WHY
I decided to apply for the fellowship because I was looking for a change in my career. I wanted an opportunity to bring all the skills and knowledge that I had learned through studying, working at universities, freelancing for small businesses and startups togethor to work on meaningful work that could have an impact on everyday citizens lives, help government deliver solutions for its citizens that meets their needs and reduce the frustration of dealing with government services.

## Recommendations
### Online Pleas
* This is ready for a pilot test
* Integration with courtlink and other systems to:
  - Provide functionality for clients to check if their case is eligible
  - Provide administration flow to properly action pleas that are requested
// ADD POTENTIAL FEATURES FROM TRELLO

### Case Triage
* this is ready for a pilot test
* pilot should focus on using the tool as the first point of interaction for staff, with paper as a backup
* Automatic case population from courtlink
* Pilot should be at 1 - 3 months
* Should eventually be part of a wider ecosystem of digital tools, linking into other systems that staff use
* Expand the reporting and data insights
// ADD POTENTIAL FEATURES FROM TRELLO

### Intranet
* document versioning
* This requires more user research, the pain points it currently addressed were more of the 'obvious' use cases, but there would be more potential for this to truly help with information / knowledge sharing
* What are the use cases for other courts?
* Any NJC website update should start to incorporate an intranet aspect as well
* Staff In/Out - this could probably be pursued as a standalone platform, focused on managing who is currently at the NJC
  - Investigate modes of updating your status to reduce friction for users, email a specific inbox, bookmarklets, webapp?
  - prompts and reminders for staff to update their status
