## Overview
* What is fellowship
* Why do we fellowship

## Research
* Clients and Stakeholders
* Context, constraints, pain points
* Think widely and wildly
* Try something - most important part
* start testing?
## Prototyping
* Be prepared to let go / pivot
*

## Refining




Fellows are tasked with giving government agencies an opportunity to prototype all the wild ideas theyve had, we help ideate, test and build the ideas that show promise and have the ability to help both citizens and government. Along the way we also try and help government develop the skills and form the partnerships they need to ensure they can continue the fantastic work

The research forms the basis of the ideation and prototyping stages, where the fellows quickly develop low cost prototypes and start to get them in front of internal and external stakeholders to better understand, develop and re-evaluate the problems they are trying to address. Along the way, ideas that show the most promise and benefit are identified for further development.

## Research
Code for Australia fellowships start with a period of research within your government department, this gives the fellows an opportunity to understand the context they will be working in, it forces the fellows to dig deep into the department, observe the day to day work staff conduct, asking questions, interviewing internal and external stakeholders and identifying areas where a small bit of technology could be the catalyst for change.

My time researching at the NJC was a mixture of shadowing staff in their various roles, mapping, reading, listening, hearing and documenting whatever I can about the background and the context the NJC operates in, sitting in on various community events and networks and getting immersed in discussions about how community Justice is done at the NJC. I spent time sitting in the court, observing staff working with clients and simply being available when situations out of the ordinary arose.

The first month was very general, understanding who the NJC are, the contexts they work within and asking lots of questions. These questions were about me trying to understand what I was observing. At this point I was starting to formulate some general themes based on the pain points I had observed, or had been told about. As we progressed into the second month, I started refining my questions based on the themes I had started to observe, I was replaying my observations back to NJC staff and asking more questions to validate my understanding of the pain point and possible opportunity, the questions were about understanding:

- Who does this pain point affect
- Why things are currently done the way they are
- What has been tried to alleviate this pain point previously


## Prototyping / Iterating

## So far
My fellowship has consisted of a series of user research, ideation and prototyping activities with not just NJC staff but also the wider community in the City of Yarra and around Melbourne, giving me an opportunity to:

* Gain a deeper understanding of who the NJC is, what they do and the space they work in
* Understand who makes up the NJC's community, how, why and when they interact with the NJC
* Capture possible opportunities and ideas that could form the basis for prototypes
* Quickly develop prototypes to allow the NJC staff and I to start to address issues that we have identified

We are now at the stage of refining some of the prototypes that have been proving to be the most beneficial and preparing to get them out in the wild.

I've enjoyed the opportunity the fellowship has given me to focus my skills, energy and time into working with staff from a diverse range of backgrounds, different levels of experiences and expectations of technology, along with complex challenges that are completely outside the usual domains of my knowledge. It has also provided me with a good opportunity to share the work that the NJC is doing to a wide range of business, tech, government and social groups and networks.
