# Fellowship
## Fellowship + me
- Hi, I'm a full stack developer, semi-decent designer and civic technology enthusiast
  * something about user research
- I'm passionate about technology, problem solving and excited about how governments can work better for their citizens

* Fellows are tasked with giving government agencies an opportunity to prototype all the wild ideas theyve had
* We build the ideas that show promise
* And hopeully, along the way we help government develop the skills and form the partnerships they need to ensure they can continue the fantastic work

## Why I fellow

I decided to apply for the fellowship because I was at stage where I was ready for a change in my career. I wanted an opportunity to bring all the skills and knowledge that I had learned through studying, working at universities, freelancing for other companies and startups and my life experience togethor to work on meaningful work that could have an impact on everyday citizens lives, help improve how government works.

The Neighbourhood Justice Centre (NJC) is Australia's only community justice centre, servicing the City of Yarra since 2007 with a focus on addressing the causes of anti-social behaviour and addressing social inequality.

Some of the key services the NJC provides include, functioning as a multi-jurisdictional Magistrate Court for the City of Yarra, providing a client problem solving approach to justice and also providing a central space for community groups and members to come togethor.

The City of Yarra is a small, but dense part of melbourne packed with businesses, community services and a growing tech community. The population is made up of a mix of people from a vast array of cultural, economic and social backgrounds all of which place the NJC perfectly as a centre for innovation within the Justice system, allowing them to explore new solutions to complex problems such as providing online access to Family violence intervention orders.

## So far
My fellowship has consisted of a series of research and prototyping activities, giving me an opportunity:

* Gain a deep understanding of who the NJC is, what they do and the space they work in
* Understand who makes up the NJC's community, how, why and when they interact with the NJC
* Capture possible opportunities and ideas that could form the basis for prototypes
* Make some initial prototypes to address issues found
* Begin to refine the prototypes that are proving most beneficial and deliverable within the year

I've enjoyed the opportunity the fellowship has given me to focus my skills, energy and time into working with staff from a diverse range of backgrounds, different levels of experiences and expectations of technology and challenges that are completely outside the usual domains of my knowledge.

The fellowship has given me the chance to work not just across the whole centre, initiating conversations, applying my skills, providing technical advice, but also the opportunity to get involved in the wider tech, social and government communities around.
