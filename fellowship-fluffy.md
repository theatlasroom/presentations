# Fellowship
## Fellowship + me
Hi, I'm a full stack developer, semi-decent designer and civic technology enthusiast, I'm passionate about technology, problem solving and excited about how governments can work better for their citizens.

Fellows are tasked with giving government agencies an opportunity to prototype all the wild ideas theyve had, we help ideate, test and build the ideas that show promise and have the ability to help both citizens and government. Along the way we also try and help government develop the skills and form the partnerships they need to ensure they can continue the fantastic work

A typical fellowship starts with a period of research within your government department, this gives the fellows an opportunity to understand the context they will be working in, it forces the fellows to dig deep into the department, observe the day to day work staff conduct, asking questions, interviewing internal and external stakeholders and identifying areas where a small bit of technology could be the catalyst for change.

The research forms the basis of the ideation and prototyping stages, where the fellows quickly develop low cost prototypes and start to get them in front of internal and external stakeholders to better understand, develop and re-evaluate the problems they are trying to address. Along the way, ideas that show the most promise and benefit are identified for further development.

## Why I fellow

I decided to apply for the fellowship because I was at stage where I was ready for a change in my career. I wanted an opportunity to bring all the skills and knowledge that I had learned through studying, working at universities, freelancing for other companies and startups and my life experience togethor to work on meaningful work that could have an impact on everyday citizens lives, help government deliver solutions for its citizens that meets their needs and reduce frustration of dealing with government services.

The Neighbourhood Justice Centre (NJC) is Australia's only community justice centre, servicing the City of Yarra since 2007 with a focus on addressing the causes of anti-social behaviour and reducing social inequality.

Some of the key services the NJC provides include, functioning as a multi-jurisdictional Magistrate Court for the City of Yarra, providing a client problem solving approach to justice and also providing a central space for community groups and members to come togethor.

The City of Yarra is a small, but dense part of melbourne packed with businesses, community services and a growing tech community. The population is made up of a mix of people from a vast array of cultural, economic and social backgrounds all of which place the NJC perfectly as a centre for innovation within the Justice system, allowing them to explore new solutions to complex problems such as providing online access to Family violence intervention orders.

## So far
My fellowship has consisted of a series of user research, ideation and prototyping activities with not just NJC staff but also the wider community in the City of Yarra and around Melbourne, giving me an opportunity to:

* Gain a deeper understanding of who the NJC is, what they do and the space they work in
* Understand who makes up the NJC's community, how, why and when they interact with the NJC
* Capture possible opportunities and ideas that could form the basis for prototypes
* Quickly develop prototypes to allow the NJC staff and I to start to address issues that we have identified

We are now at the stage of refining some of the prototypes that have been proving to be the most beneficial and preparing to get them out in the wild.

I've enjoyed the opportunity the fellowship has given me to focus my skills, energy and time into working with staff from a diverse range of backgrounds, different levels of experiences and expectations of technology, along with complex challenges that are completely outside the usual domains of my knowledge. It has also provided me with a good opportunity to share the work that the NJC is doing to a wide range of business, tech, government and social groups and networks.
