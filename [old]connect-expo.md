## Key points

  - an opportunity to really start to understand the complexities of an idea before going to market
  - you can involve stakeholders early on which can help with buy-in, idea validation and making sure you are meeting a real users needs

## Intro
Hey today, im here to talk a bit about prototyping, innovation, lean methodology and all those other interesting topics, but with the caveat of.....how it can be done within government.

You might think I sound crazy, and you might be thinking these 2 concepts are mutually exclusive, but there are definately ways out there to get the ball rolling and I want to talk a little bit about my experiences, particularly over the last 9months as a Code for Australia Fellow.

## About me
I am a full stack developer, a bit of a designer, if i was to compare my design skills to a car i'd probably be something like a ford, i don't have all the bells and whistles, but I can get the job done.

I have been working as a web developer over the past ~7 years with a majority of that time spent working at universities, ive also had the opportunity to freelance for both established small businesses and startups.
