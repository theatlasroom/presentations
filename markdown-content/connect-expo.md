## In government
![Obama running](./images/obama-running.gif)
## Note:
You might think I sound crazy, and you might be thinking these 2 concepts are mutually exclusive, but there are definately ways to get ideas moving in the public sector and I want to talk a little bit about my experiences over the last 9months as a Code for Australia Fellow.


## Me
* Code for Australia Fellow
* Full stack developer
* I do designy-ish things
* I love football

## Note:
I am a full stack developer, a bit of a designer, if i was to compare my design skills to a car i'd probably be something like a ford, i don't have all the bells and whistles, but I can get the job done.

I have been working as a web developer over the past ~7 years with a majority of that time spent working at universities, ive also had the opportunity to freelance for both established small businesses and startups.

I love programming, I love finding solutions to problems and getting ideas off the ground.

I am currently a Code for Australia fellow.



## Code for Australia
We are a network of skilled citizens that are helping transform government
## Note:
We are a network of skilled citizens, designers, developers, community organisers, whoever, that are helping transform government

## Code for Australia
Government can work together with the public and private sector to develop a more responsive government and create meaningful change through technology.


![Code for all](./images/code-for-all.png)
## Note:
We are part of a global network of like-minded organisations, sharing our ideas, stories and open source code to help governments around the world move towards the same goals.


![Gov IT fail](./images/gov-it-fail.png)
## Note:
Why do we do this?


![Bridge the gap](./images/bridge-the-gap.png)
This is the space we work in


## Fellowship?
![Lego Fellowship](./images/lego-fellowship.jpg)
## Note:
One of the ways we try and achieve this, is through our fellowship program. Fellows are sent out into government departments for a fixed period of public service.

Fellows are tasked with giving government agencies an opportunity to prototype all the wild ideas theyve had, we help ideate, test and build the ideas that show promise and have the ability to help both citizens and government. Along the way we also try and help government develop the skills and form the partnerships they need to ensure they can continue the fantastic work

A typical fellowship starts with a period of research within your government department, this gives the fellows an opportunity to understand the context they will be working in, it forces the fellows to dig deep into the department, observe the day to day work staff conduct, asking questions, interviewing internal and external stakeholders and identifying areas where a small bit of technology could be the catalyst for change.

The research forms the basis of the ideation and prototyping stages, where the fellows quickly develop low cost prototypes and start to get them in front of internal and external stakeholders to better understand, develop and re-evaluate the problems they are trying to address. Along the way, ideas that show the most promise and benefit are identified for further development.



## Why on earth...
## Note:
I decided to apply for the fellowship because I was at stage where I was ready for a change in my career. I wanted an opportunity to bring all the skills and knowledge that I had learned through studying, working at universities, freelancing for other companies and startups and my life experience togethor to work on meaningful work that could have an impact on everyday citizens lives, help government deliver solutions for its citizens that meets their needs and reduce frustration of dealing with government services.


## NJC
* Committed to addressing the causes of anti-social behaviour
* Prototypical arm of Magistrates courts victoria

## Note:
The Neighbourhood Justice Centre (NJC) is Australia's only community justice centre, servicing the City of Yarra since 2007 with a focus on addressing the causes of anti-social behaviour and reducing social inequality.

Some of the key services the NJC provides include, functioning as a multi-jurisdictional Magistrate Court for the City of Yarra, providing a client problem solving approach to justice and also providing a central space for community groups and members to come togethor.

The City of Yarra is a small, but dense part of melbourne packed with businesses, community services and a growing tech community. The population is made up of a mix of people from a vast array of cultural, economic and social backgrounds all of which place the NJC perfectly as a centre for innovation within the Justice system, allowing them to explore new solutions to complex problems such as providing online access to Family violence intervention orders.



## Problem
Hey, how can we provide clients with secure, up to date access to their court documents?

## Note:
Early on in my fellowship, one of the problems that kept emerging was the lack of access that clients have to information about their court cases. After a bit of thinking, we boiled it down to that statement, simply "how can we provide clients with secure, up to date access to their court documents?"

* We knew this could be a large project in itself, so we decided to focus in a bit more on one use case

* We focused on clients with Personal safety / Family violence intervention orders

* Why is something like this important? Primarily so they dont need to re-articulate the terms of their order / have it on hand when they need

* We needed to boil down the process to something simple and digestable, so we could quickly validate the idea not get bogged down in the specifics

* We felt like it needed to model the users experience, not just show the interfaces


## First - Paper
![started in paper](./images/fvio-paper-1.jpg)
## Note:
* First, we started in paper....and, considering i spend most of my life working on screens and anything digital, I'm happy to report that I survived
* 45mins + post it notes and some paper


## Next steps...
## Note:
* I created a basic responsive online version
* I jumped straight from the paper prototypes into code
* It consisted of a fake login page that would take you directly through to the application
* We added the relevant metadata and favicons so that we could save the bookmark and have it appear like an app
* I was also provided with a mock intervention order which i populated the viewer with
* The only trickery was the username field, that carried over to the next page or if you didnt enter anything, defaults to guest... simple right
* It was ugly and crude, but functional enough to test and explain the concept

## So what happened?
![Tell me more](./images/tell-me-more.gif)
## Note:
* We wanted to check that this was the idea the director had in mind and also get her a bit excited about it, if she was onboard it'd make it easier to get other staff on board down the track
* So we decided to just hijack her phone and prepare the bookmark on her homescreen
* We asked to borrow her phone, loaded it up to ensure the docs were cached and then pulled her aside
* A brief explanation and a few minutes later she was off showing and telling everyone she could get a minute with


## Nice
![Liz Lemon high five cat](./images/liz-lemon-high-five.gif)

## Note:
* This all happened about 15mins before the centre was about to be presented with an innovation award from DPC (dept premier and cabinet)
* The centre was packed with various staff from different levels of government and not only the Department of Justice
* So some of the people that were shown included members of DPC and state ministers that were also in attendance
* While this prototype ended there, it provided an opportunity for us to:
  - Connect with non-technical staff around a possible solution, particularly the court registry who would be required to make the most changes to their work, and figure out how we could integrate it into their workflow
  - Connect with clients and start to learn about the usefulness of such a solution
  - Think about the external complexities
* The NJC will be implementing the ideas into future iterations of their the family violence online service



## Problem
* How can we reduce the time clients spend at court?
* How can we prepare courts to deliver transactional services digitally?

## Note:
Another problem, not just at the NJC but across all magistrate courts is the time spent by clients waiting for their case to be heard. This can be due to a range of issues, including:

- Too many cases coming through the court
- Complex cases taking longer than expected
- The lack of digitisation of court services

This waiting and uncertainty about the state of your matter can cause unwarranted stress and strain on citizens who more than likely, already are in a very stressful situation. How can we better utilize the time and resources of the courts to focus on the most complex of issues, while still giving all citizens a fair go.

Increasingly, citizens are expecting and demanding to be able to conduct transactional government activities online, thinking of paying a fine, applying for a permit. Why? because of the convenience, digital offers an opportunity for citizens to connect with the public service from, wherever and whenever they CHOOSE to.

## Not bad hey?
![obama not bad](./images/obama-not-bad.gif)
* ~30mins of sketching, listening to music and mapping out the process
* ~5mins to take a photo of all the screens and link them up into a Fellow
* lots of redrawing because my handwriting is super messy


## And then..
## Note:
This prototype was co-designed by myself and another NJC staff member, Gavin Hince and it took us roughly 35mins to draw, photograph (on our phones), link togethor and test.

In short, the solution provides an option for citizens, convicted of a minor offence such as traffic offences and unpaid fines, to accept a guilty plea online, it might seem strange for someone to accept a charge but for some citizens, the idea of taking a day off work to attend court for an offence they are not planning to contest can cost them more than the price of the offence.

The plea is sent to the relevant court registry, who can provide it to the magistrate during the quieter times of the day. The magistrate can review the case and if they feel like they have sufficient information, finalise a decision, otherwise they can issue an adjournment of the case.


## Progress
## Note:
Within the next couple of months after the initial prototype, we were able to take the prototype to all the key stakeholders, the magistrate, the registry staff and some lawyers to start the discussion of how we could get this idea off the ground. And get the ball rolling for a real working solution.

One of the challenges in progressing the idea was getting all the key stakeholders togethor for regular feedback on progress and to help us overcame both the legal and technical challenges.

So we set aside fortnightly progress meetings, initially for the director, the magistrate and key legal staff, but it has also grown to include Police prosecutors and the registry staff.

Each progress meeting allows all the stakeholders to review progress that has been made in the last fortnight, plan changes for the next fortnight and raise any concerns might have arisen. In between the progress meetings, we have been using a Trello board to manage tasks, communicate changes ask for help and document anything that happens. Why trello? simply because it was one of the few tools we could all access from within the department of justice network and the barrier of entry and onboarding for non-technical staff is very low.....its also free :D

For anyone familiar with the buzzwords lean, agile and kanban, this will probably all sound familiar.

## Whats next?
## Note:
* This has not only helped us get traction for the idea, and drive buy-in and interest within the centre, it has also provided us opportunity to fail early by making assumptions where we didnt need too much detail and deferring until more information was on hand
* The POP prototype also gave us a fun, low tech option to really showcase the solution we had envisaged, get a wider range of stakeholders into the conversation early on and we did not have to rely on just how well we could describe it people.
* Testing testing and testing, we hope to soon start testing with clients in different scenarios, targeting candidate cases and providing online as an option for clients. We will also be including a 1 page flyer in the summons pack that is sent for candidate cases:
* We need to refine some of the information that is collected to ensure:
  - it is useful enough for the magistrate to make a clear decision
  - it is easy and painless for users
  - doesnt cause an extra burden on the court registry



## Some things I've learnt
* What are we testing?
* Aim for the lowest fidelity you NEED
* Show tangible progress
* Find your internal champions
* Have fun - prototype with people

## Note:
So in summary, these are some general things i've learnt about or had reinforced to me during my time as a fellow, working on problems like the ones I have just gone over.

Make sure you understand what you want to be testing, the goal with a prototype is usually to test a concept, or an idea and make sure that it is sound, or tease out some of the complexities before you commit to a solution. The goal is definately not to design the most perfect solution.

Following on, try and make sure that you are only ever prototyping at an appropriate level of fidelity at each stage, I always have the inclination to jump straight into code, but I know that most of the time a quick sketch, maybe some wireframes or a mockup can provide just as much insight as a live prototype.

One of the other reasons to prototype quickly is to help gain internal momentum and buy-in to your ideas, showing progress and giving stakeholders, both internal and public users, something tangible (whether it be a mock or real) and it allows them the opportunity to provide you with feedback and help make sure your solution aligns with their needs.

Most importantly, you need to find your internal champions, these are the people who will do the nitty-gritty running around for you, setting up meetings, checking in with colleagues chasing down details on the more obscure, nonsensical parts of government policy and overall, help ensure your projects continue to move.
