## Hi
![hi]()
## Note:
Hey today, im here to talk a bit about prototyping, innovation, lean-ish practice and all those other interesting topics, and how they can be applied..... within government and the public sector.

You might think I sound crazy, and you might be thinking these 2 concepts are mutually exclusive, but there are definately ways out there to get the ball rolling and I want to talk a little bit about my experiences over the last 9months as a Code for Australia Fellow.


## Me
![me]()
* Full stack developer
* I do designy-ish things
* I love football

## Note:
I am a full stack developer, a bit of a designer, if i was to compare my design skills to a car i'd probably be something like a ford, i don't have all the bells and whistles, but I can get the job done.

I have been working as a web developer over the past ~7 years with a majority of that time spent working at universities, ive also had the opportunity to freelance for both established small businesses and startups.

I love programming, I love getting finding solutions and love getting ideas off the ground.



## Code for Australia


## Note:
Code is...


## Fellowship?
![Lego Fellowship](./images/lego-fellowship.jpg)
## Note:
Fellows are tasked with giving government agencies an opportunity to prototype all the wild ideas theyve had, we help ideate, test and build the ideas that show promise and have the ability to help both citizens and government. Along the way we also try and help government develop the skills and form the partnerships they need to ensure they can continue the fantastic work

A typical fellowship starts with a period of research within your government department, this gives the fellows an opportunity to understand the context they will be working in, it forces the fellows to dig deep into the department, observe the day to day work staff conduct, asking questions, interviewing internal and external stakeholders and identifying areas where a small bit of technology could be the catalyst for change.

The research forms the basis of the ideation and prototyping stages, where the fellows quickly develop low cost prototypes and start to get them in front of internal and external stakeholders to better understand, develop and re-evaluate the problems they are trying to address. Along the way, ideas that show the most promise and benefit are identified for further development.



## Why on earth...
## Note:
I decided to apply for the fellowship because I was at stage where I was ready for a change in my career. I wanted an opportunity to bring all the skills and knowledge that I had learned through studying, working at universities, freelancing for other companies and startups and my life experience togethor to work on meaningful work that could have an impact on everyday citizens lives, help government deliver solutions for its citizens that meets their needs and reduce frustration of dealing with government services.


## NJC
* Committed to addressing the causes of anti-social behaviour
* Prototypical arm of Magistrates courts victoria

## Note:
The Neighbourhood Justice Centre (NJC) is Australia's only community justice centre, servicing the City of Yarra since 2007 with a focus on addressing the causes of anti-social behaviour and reducing social inequality.

Some of the key services the NJC provides include, functioning as a multi-jurisdictional Magistrate Court for the City of Yarra, providing a client problem solving approach to justice and also providing a central space for community groups and members to come togethor.

The City of Yarra is a small, but dense part of melbourne packed with businesses, community services and a growing tech community. The population is made up of a mix of people from a vast array of cultural, economic and social backgrounds all of which place the NJC perfectly as a centre for innovation within the Justice system, allowing them to explore new solutions to complex problems such as providing online access to Family violence intervention orders.



## Problem
Hey, how can we provide clients with secure, up to date access to their court documents?

## Note:
Early on in my fellowship, one of the problems that kept emerging was the lack of access that clients have to information about their court cases. After a bit of thinking, we boiled it down to that statement, simply "how can we provide clients with secure, up to date access to their court documents?"

* We knew this could be a large project in itself, so we decided to focus in a bit more on one use case

* We focused on clients with Personal safety / Family violence intervention orders

* Why is something like this important? Primarily so they dont need to re-articulate the terms of their order / have it on hand when they need

* We needed to boil down the process to something simple and digestable, so we could quickly validate the idea not get bogged down in the specifics

* We felt like it needed to model the users experience, not just show the interfaces


## First - Paper
![started in paper](./images/fvio-paper-1.jpg)
## Note:
* First, we started in paper....and, considering i spend most of my life working on screens and anything digital, I'm happy to report that I survived
* 45mins + post it notes and some paper


## Next steps...
## Note:
* I created a basic responsive online version
* I jumped straight from the paper prototypes into code
* It consisted of a fake login page that would take you directly through to the application
* We added the relevant metadata and favicons so that we could save the bookmark and have it appear like an app
* I was also provided with a mock intervention order which i populated the viewer with
* The only trickery was the username field, that carried over to the next page or if you didnt enter anything, defaults to guest... simple right
* It was ugly and crude, but functional enough to test and explain the concept

## So what happened?
![Tell me more](./images/tell-me-more.gif)
## Note:
* We wanted to check that this was the idea the director had in mind and also get her a bit excited about it, if she was onboard it'd make it easier to get other staff on board down the track
* So we decided to just hijack her phone and prepare the bookmark on her homescreen
* We asked to borrow her phone, loaded it up to ensure the docs were cached and then pulled her aside
* A brief explanation and a few minutes later she was off showing and telling everyone she could get a minute with


## Nice

## Note:
* This all happened about 15mins before the centre was about to be presented with an innovation award from DPC (dept premier and cabinet)
* The centre was packed with various staff from different levels of government and not only the Department of Justice
* So some of the people that were shown included members of DPC and state ministers that were also in attendance
* While this prototype ended there, it provided an opportunity for us to:
  - Connect with non-technical staff around a possible solution, particularly the court registry who would be required to make the most changes to their work
  - Connect with clients and start to learn about the usefulness of such a solution
  - Think about the external complexities
* The NJC will be looking to implement some of the work into future iterations of their the family violence online service


## Some things I've learnt
* What are we testing?
* Aim for the lowest fidelity you NEED
* Show tangible progress
* Find your internal champions

## Note:
So here are some general things i've learnt about during my time as a fellow.

Make sure you understand what you want to be testing, the goal with a prototype is usually to test a concept, or an idea and make sure that it is sound, or tease out some of the complexities before you commit to a solution. The goal is definately not to design the most perfect solution.

Following on, try and make sure that you are only ever prototyping at an appropriate level of fidelity at each stage, I always have the inclination to jump straight into code, but I know that most of the time a quick sketch, maybe some wireframes or a mockup can provide just as much insight as a live prototype.

One of the other reasons to prototype quickly is to help gain internal momentum and buy-in to your ideas, showing progress and giving stakeholders, both internal and public users, something tangible (whether it be a mock or real) and it allows them the opportunity to provide you with feedback and help make sure your solution aligns with their needs.

Most importantly, you need to find your internal champions, these are the people who will do the nitty-gritty running around for you, setting up meetings, checking in with colleagues chasing down details on the more obscure, nonsensical parts of government policy and overall, help ensure your projects continue to move.
