## Me
![Tell me more](./images/tell-me-more.gif)
* Code for Australia Fellow
* Full stack developer
* I do designy-ish things
* I love football

## Note:
I am a full stack developer, a bit of a designer, if i was to compare my design skills to a car i'd probably be something like a ford, i don't have all the bells and whistles, but I can get the job done.

I have been working as a web developer over the past ~7 years with a majority of that time spent working at universities, ive also had the opportunity to freelance for both established small businesses and startups.

I love programming, I love finding solutions to problems and getting ideas off the ground.

I am currently a Code for Australia fellow and have been working with NodeJS for roughly the last 12 months


## Code for Australia
![Obama running](./images/obama-running.gif)

We are a network of skilled citizens that are helping transform government
## Note:
We are a network of skilled citizens, designers, developers, community organisers, whoever, that are helping transform government

## Code for Australia
Government can work together with the public and private sector to develop a more responsive government and create meaningful change through technology.


![Code for all](./images/code-for-all.png)
## Note:
We are part of a global network of like-minded organisations, sharing our ideas, stories and open source code to help governments around the world move towards the same goals.


![Gov IT fail](./images/gov-it-fail.png)
## Note:
Why do we do this?
Because Government IT projects have an unfortunate track record of failure


![Bridge the gap](./images/bridge-the-gap.png)
This is the space we work in, trying to bridge the gap between citizens expectations and government delivery


## Fellowship?
![Lego Fellowship](./images/lego-fellowship.jpg)
## Note:
One of the ways we try and achieve this, is through our fellowship program. Fellows are sent out into government departments for a fixed period of public service.

Fellows are tasked with giving government agencies an opportunity to prototype all the wild ideas theyve had, we help ideate, test and build the ideas that show promise and have the ability to help both citizens and government. Along the way we also try and help government develop the skills and form the partnerships they need to ensure they can continue the fantastic work

For government the main benefit in the program has is usually the opportunity they have to try various ideas cheaply, with a  low investment of time and money removing some of the main barriers and opposition to innovation and providing an opportunity to start exploring solutions that can have a real impact.


## So...why node?
"I just need something to show my stakeholders so we can start to test, trial and iterate"
## Note:
So for my fellowship, the majority of my work has been exploring different possible ideas and prototyping them. I'm not building bullet-proof, highly optimised solutions, I just need something to show my stakedholders that we can start to test, trial and iterate on.

So we're talking about things like:
* Simple CRUD style apps to expose
* Online services to replace paper based services
* Applications to bridge legacy tools / systems that dont talk to each other


## What about < insert language >
![Deal with it](./images/deal-with-it.gif)

## Note:
Sure all of these problems can be solved in any number of frameworks like rails, django, laravel, but I chose node



## Node niceness
* Ecosystem
  - express: rest apis
  - cheerio: web scraping
  - passport: user authentication made easy  
  - left pad: LOL
* Ubiquity  
* The community
* It's all just javascript
* It's (still?) shiny and new

## Note:
For me, some of the attraction to NodeJS was:
* The great ecosystem of plugins, I don't want to spend my life reinventing the wheel, I want to focus on implementing solutions and get them to people in the real world
  - express: rest apis
  - cheerio: web scraping
  - passport: user authentication made easy  
  - left pad: LOL
* ubiquity: the node runtime can be executed in so many places.
  - Are you using linux, windows or osx? no worries.
  - interested in robots? drones? IoT? - cool!
* The great community of developers, the community is very active and there are lots of resources out there for you to learn from
* and of course...The dream of working with one language, on the front and back end, allowing me to focus on the solution not the technology, im not constantly switching between different languages and packages, i can reuse them across the front and back.
* It's shiny / new

## Learning curve
* Javascript (duh)
* npm, packages.json and modules
* Callbacks, Promises
* Buffers and Streams
* fs, http, EventEmitters
* [Error handling](https://www.joyent.com/developers/node/design/errors)

## Note:
So while node offers a lot of nice things out of the box, there are still a few hurdles you'll probably come across when you're diving in. But if you take some time to invest in learning a few key concepts, the rest will come. If you already understand javascript syntax, I recommend looking particularily at:
- Package management with npm and understanding modules
- Callbacks and Promises
- Buffers and streams
- core packages like fs, http, EventEmitters

The nodejs documentation provides some great information and there are just so many good books and tutorials online to get you going.
