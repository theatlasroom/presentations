						<h2>Now... these are pretty cool</h2>

						<h2>CourtBot</h2>
						<img src="./images/atl-court.png" alt="Atlanta Municipal Court Queue" height="500px" />
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Developed by the Atlanta CfA fellows</li>
								<li>In Atlanta, when you receive a traffic infringement, no matter how minor, the simplest way to resolve it is to go to court and settle the matter. This results in people taking the day off work, only to stand in line waiting to get in.</li>
								<li>So what courtbot offers, is on the spot information about traffic citations</li>
								<li>Text your citation number, receive information on how to resolve your infringment</li>
								<p>CourtBot can provide information on:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>If a case can be paid immediately, the app offers a phone number and link to begin payment.</li>
									<li>If a case requires a court appearance, the app allows users to sign up for reminders, served 24 hours in advance of the case.</li>
									<li>If a case isn't in the system (usually because it takes two weeks for paper citations to be put into the computer), the app allows users to get information when it becomes available. The app continues checking each day for up to 16 days and sends the case information when found (or an apology if not).</li>
									<li>Steps to take to challenge the citation</li>
								</ul>

						<h2>Promptly</h2>
						<img src="./images/promptly.png" alt="Promptly" />
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Many food stamp recipients in San Francisco discover theyve been disenrolled from the program when it is too late, and they are actually at the grocery store</p>
							<p>Recipients are then required to re-apply to be put back on the benefits program</p>
							<p>Promptly was designed to identify recipients that were about to be disenrolled and send them a text message notification before its too late</p>
							<p>While not strictly for food stamps, promptly provides features for scheduling, monitoring and sending text message notifications for any reason</p>

						<h2>The Hive</h2>
						<img height="475px" data-src="./images/the-hive.png" alt="The Hive" />
						<p>By: Harvest Digital Planning</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The Hive is a simple set of drag and drop tools you can configure to quickly produce a website to promote a topic or drive user engagement</p>
							<p>Some of the sites developed have been for</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Events - communicating and promotion</li>
								<li>Highlighting issues that require community feedback or participation</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Out of the box, the hive offers tools like</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Support for all types of multimedia</li>
								<li>Maps for communicating spatial information, or for map based feedback</li>
								<li>Infographics for communicating concepts and ideas</li>
